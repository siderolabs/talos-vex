      This is a very common CVE of Low severity, however if it is a concern you need to configure your firewall
      to reject ICMP timestamp requests. However, this does not have high impact on security in most cases.

  ### These CVEs have erroneous version ranges in databases, these records should be sometimes re-checked
  ### CVEs from before Linux has become a CNA are likely to have incorrect version ranges
  ### These are likely already fixed, but missing the version range information in the databases
  ### We consider CVEs published before 2023 as fixed in 6.12 and later, since vulnerabilities
  ### are usually disclosed after a fix is available in the mainline kernel
