# Talos Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange

[OpenVEX](https://github.com/openvex/spec/blob/main/OPENVEX-SPEC.md) is a standard for communicating the exploitability of vulnerabilities of components in a software product. This repository contains such information for [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos), as well as the tool we maintain to generate VEX documents for different versions and editions of Talos.

## Usage

VEX document for the corresponding version can be used to aid vulnerability scanning and management by hiding vulnerabilities that are not exploitable in a particular software version or edition.

## Updating databases and generating VEX documents

This section is mostly relevant for maintainers of Talos, but you are welcome to make use of the tool to manage VEX data for your own projects, managing exploitability data in the same way.
